      <description>This is an attempt to learn more about how people structure Clojure projects and which patterns they commonly use. I started this with only basic knowledge about Clojure and ClojureScript, but not without knowledge about the Lisp-family of languages or functional programming in general.
My goal here is to &amp;ldquo;mine&amp;rdquo; different projects for things to learn about Clojure. As such I may be a little all over the place, searching for things to learn.</description>
